Scenario - Football table
There are four main requirements of this coding exercise:
1. Write a standalone application that will read in values from a pre-defined text file, 'football.dat'. The file includes information relating to football teams, the games played, goals scored per match, etc.
2. Display the data within the file in a JTable in the same order as that within the text file.
3. Include a button in the frame that, when clicked, calculates the most consistent team. The definition of 'consistent' is left open.
4. The calculation of the most consistent team will be performed off the Event Dispatch Thread (EDT), such that after pressing the button the EDT will not freeze while calculating.

Packaging
Package the source code alongside a built Football.jar file. The jar file must be runnable, and the code must compile without exceptions.

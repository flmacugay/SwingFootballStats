Time Taken:
1.5 days to complete

Design:
MVC design pattern is used to separate data and user interface concerns so that changes to the user interface will not affect data handling making the application more maintainable.

Model (FootballStatsModel and TableModel) - represents data from interface file football.dat and the business logic to calculate the most consistent team
View (FootballStatsView) - class where components are arranged and components' properties are set. 
Controller (FootballStatsController) - it keeps model and view separated. controls all actions and data flow from model and view.


Assumption:
- data from file is tab delimited
- first line of file contains table headers
- file football.dat is on the same folder as the executable jar
- no sort functionality
- data from text file is displayed as is, data is not validated.
- any changes to football.dat will not refresh the table
- netbeans IDE designer is used to design user interface


Exception Handling:
- "Unable to load file" is displayed when file is not found
- "Unable to calculate" is displayed when scores contain letters or special characters


Possible improvements:
- data validation of football.dat
- improve algorithm in calculating most consistent team
- display multiple teams when teams have equal consistency ratings
- maintain error messages and location of football.dat in a properties file
- create test scripts for regression testing
